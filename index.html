<br><h2> Why Gang Beasts is so amazing</h2> <image src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiW5rPKp8TaAhWpdd8KHeWxCwsQjRx6BAgAEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFile%3AGang_Beasts_Logo.png&psig=AOvVaw0ViGfADNLdE2CuCjUJWD7B&ust=1524157549200705"></image>
<p>On August 29 2014 the world was blessed by an amazing game locally known as "Gang Beasts"<br><br>Gang Beasts is a multiplayer beat-up party game where 8 players can battle it out on multiple different stages. Each stage is unique and has varying and multiple obsticles and hazards built in. The main objective of the game is to knock out your opponent throw them off of the stage and be the last one standing.
 Sounds easy right, however very player is fighting against everyone, that means you could have 7 people all after you at once.
 <br><br>Another great thing about this game are the glitches, and you are probably thinking "why are glitches good, they are not supposed to be ther"  </p>
